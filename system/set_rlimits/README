set_rlimits ( access realtime scheduling ) 

It is a small program written to give unpriviledged users access to realtime scheduling via the new rlimits added to kernel 2.6.12.

The new name reflects the fact that the program can control resource limits rather than just those related to realtime priorities. This new version adds a more flexible configuration file format, easier command line use and the ability to control the memlock resource limit. Read the enclosed README file and manpage for full details.
