Traverso ( Multitrack DAW )

Traverso is an audio recording and editing program which is very well suited to record a single voice, a band, an ensemble, a whole orchestra or any other source of music.

Optional deps:

portaudio (optional)
jack (optional)
lame (optional for MP3 write support) 

For LV2 support the stock redland and rasqal packages need upgrading so this option is turned off currently.
