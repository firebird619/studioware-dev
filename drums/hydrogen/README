Hydrogen ( Advanced drum machine )

Hydrogen is an advanced drum machine for GNU/Linux. It's main goal is to bring professional yet simple and intuitive pattern-based drum programming. 

Optional deps for hydrogen are: 
jack-audio-connection-kit (optional, default=yes)
lash (optional, default=yes)
portaudio (optional, default=yes)
portmidi (optional, default=yes)

Optional deps can be set with the following flags:

JACK=yes|no
LASH=yes|no
PORTAUDIO=yes|no

PORTAUDIO=yes enables portmidi support.

*Note: if portaudio was built with jack support then
hydrogen will require it too.
