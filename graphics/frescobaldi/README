Frescobaldi is a LilyPond sheet music text editor for KDE4. It aims to be powerful, yet lightweight and easy to use.

Mandatory for typesetting but not for compile: lilypond.

Optional tools: Not required for compilation. You can use rumor to insert notes via midi (ex. keyboard) and timidity for midi playback. You need to configure both timidity and some other midi playback program like audacious.
