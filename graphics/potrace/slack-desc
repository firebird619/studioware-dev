# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

potrace: potrace ( transform bitmaps into smooth, scalable images ) 
potrace:
potrace: Potrace(TM) is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means,        
potrace: transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a
potrace: bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP format), and the default output is an
potrace: encapsulated PostScript file (EPS). A typical use is to create EPS 
potrace: files from scanned data, such as company or university logos,      
potrace: handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a  
potrace: bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.
