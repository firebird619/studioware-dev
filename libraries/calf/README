calf ( calf audio plugin pack ) 

The Calf project aims at providing a set of high quality open source audio plugins for musicians. All the included plugins are designed to be used with multitrack software, as software replacement for instruments and guitar stomp boxes (and not as single modules in a modular synthesizer, which was a primary design goal in some other open source plugin packages.
