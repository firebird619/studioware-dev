Mini-XML ( Lightweight XML Library )

Mini-XML is a small XML library that you can use to read and write XML and XML-like data files in your application without requiring large non-standard libraries. Mini-XML only requires an ANSI C compatible compiler (GCC works, as do most vendors' ANSI C compilers) and a 'make' program.

Mini-XML supports reading of UTF-8 and UTF-16 and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files and strings. Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure, preserving the XML data hierarchy, and arbitrary element names, attributes, and attribute values are supported with no preset limits, just available memory.
