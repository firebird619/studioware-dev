wxGTK ( cross-platform GUI toolkit )

wxGTK is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's controls and utilities.

This is a unicode shared build.  If you do not want the unicode build, use: UNICODE=NO ./wxGTK.SlackBuild

This package conflicts with wxPython because wxGTK is already included there. Both cannot be installed at the same time.
