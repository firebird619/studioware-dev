# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

scons: scons ( a software construction tool ) 
scons:
scons: SCons is a software construction toolâ€”that is, a superior alternative
scons: to the classic "Make" build tool that we all know and love.          
scons: SCons is implemented as a Python script and set of modules, and SCons
scons: "configuration files" are actually executed as Python scripts. This  
scons: gives SCons many powerful capabilities not found in other software   
scons: build tools.
