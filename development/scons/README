scons ( a software construction tool ) 

SCons is a software construction tool that is, a superior alternative to the classic "Make" build tool that we all know and love. SCons is implemented as a Python script and set of modules, and SCons "configuration files" are actually executed as Python scripts. This gives SCons many powerful capabilities not found in other software build tools.
