amSynth ( Analogue Modeling SYNTHesizer )

It provides virtual analogue synthesis in the style of the classic Moog Minimoog/Roland Junos. It offers an easy-to-use interface and synth engine, while still creating varied sounds.

If you want to use this package with jack it will pick up on whether jack is installed during configure. Note that this is 'jack' _not_ 'jack-audio-connection-kit'.
